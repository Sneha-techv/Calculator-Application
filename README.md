Objective / Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to create a Calculator Application that demonstrates the concept of Method Overloading in Java.
The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using overloaded methods with different data types and parameters.

Project Objectives

To understand and apply the concept of method overloading in Java.

To implement overloaded methods for arithmetic operations.

To use Java control structures and input/output operations.

To handle different data types and parameter combinations.

To write modular and object-oriented Java programs.

Learning Outcomes

Gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

Practiced method overloading and polymorphism in real-world scenarios.

Learned how to use overloaded methods for performing multiple operations.

Understood how to upload and manage code using GitHub.

Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of Method Overloading in Java through a simple Calculator Application.
It helped in understanding how one method name can handle multiple types of parameters and perform different operations.
The project also improved knowledge of object-oriented concepts, exception handling, and control structures.
